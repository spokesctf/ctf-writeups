Here's the challenge:

Attack of the Pentium 4 - 469 points at conclusion (27 solves)

You really want to play Run 3, but your poor Pentium 4 isn't fast enough! You've heard there's a computer shop worthy of thunderous praise in this building, but you need an expert opinion on their services first. If a computer is good enough to work on games, it should be good enough to play them. Itâ€™s been rumored that someone who works on games once purchased a computer from here. Can you find their first game?
Flag format: UMASS{name of the game in English}, for example UMASS{Elden Ring}
